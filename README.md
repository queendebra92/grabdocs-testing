🧠 GrabDocs — Intelligent Document Management Automated Tests
This repository contains automated end-to-end tests for GrabDocs, an intelligent document management platform.
Tests are implemented using Python, Pytest, and Playwright to validate key user workflows such as authentication, workspace management, uploads, and chat functionality.

⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
git clone git@github.com:swilltec/grabdocs_tests.git
cd grabdocs-tests
2. Create a Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt doesn’t exist yet, create it with:

pytest
playwright
pytest-playwright
python-dotenv
Then install Playwright browsers:

playwright install
🔐 Environment Variables
Set credentials used for logging into GrabDocs:

export EMAIL="your_email@example.com"
export PASSWORD="your_password"
Or create a .env file:

EMAIL=your_email@example.com
PASSWORD=your_password
▶️ Running the Tests
Run all tests:

pytest -v
Run a specific test file:

pytest tests/test_auth.py -v
Run tests in headed mode (browser visible):

pytest --headed
🧪 What the Tests Cover
Test File	Description
test_auth.py	Validates login, remember-me, and logout flow
test_workspace.py	Creates and deletes team workspaces
test_chat.py	Tests chat input and message visibility
test_files.py	Uploads files to the dashboard and validates success
Each test reuses an authenticated Playwright context managed by conftest.py, preventing redundant logins and improving test efficiency.

🧰 Key Fixtures
Fixture	Scope	Description
base_url	session	The GrabDocs app base URL
email / password	session	User credentials from environment
browser_context	session	Provides a single browser session
authenticated_context	session	Logs in and reuses an authenticated browser context
📤 Upload Test Example
page.set_input_files("input[type='file']", "Grabdocs Test Plan.pdf")
expect(page.get_by_text("No documents uploaded yet")).not_to_be_visible()
This test validates that file uploads successfully remove the "No documents uploaded yet" message on the GrabDocs Upload page.

🧹 Notes
If logged_in.json exists, tests will reuse it for faster sessions.
Some tests (e.g. “Remember Me”) may be known to fail due to unimplemented features in the current production environment.
You can safely delete logged_in.json to force reauthentication.
